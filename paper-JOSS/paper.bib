abstract = {The dependence between the anomeric carbon chemical shift and the glycosidic bond (phi, psi) dihedral angles in oligosaccharide and glycopeptide model compounds was studied by Gauge-Including Atomic Orbital (GIAO) ab initio calculations. Complete chemical shift surfaces versus phi and psi for D-Glcp-D-Glcp disaccharides with (1--{\textgreater}1), (1--{\textgreater}2), (1--{\textgreater}3), and (1--{\textgreater}4) linkages in both alpha- and beta-configurations were computed using a 3-21G basis set, and scaled to reference results from calculations at the 6-311G** level of theory. Similar surfaces were obtained for GlcNAcThr and GlcNAcSer model glycopeptides in alpha- and beta-configurations, using in this case different conformations for the peptide moiety. The results obtained for both families of model compounds are discussed. We also present the determination of empirical formulas of the form 13Cdelta = f (phi,psi) obtained by fitting the raw ab initio data to trigonometric series expansions suitable for use in molecular mechanics and dynamics simulations. Our investigations are consistent with experimental observations and earlier calculations performed on smaller glycosidic bond models, and show the applicability of chemical shift surfaces in the study of the conformational behavior of oligosaccharides and glycopeptides.},

@article{Martin2012,
abstract = {The differences between observed and predicted (13)C($\alpha$) chemical shifts can be used as a sensitive probe with which to detect possible local flaws in protein structures. For this reason, we previously introduced CheShift, a Web server for protein structure validation. Now, we present CheShift-2 in which a graphical user interface is implemented to render such local flaws easily visible. A series of applications to 15 ensembles of conformations illustrate the ability of CheShift-2 to locate the main structural flaws rapidly and accurately on a per-residue basis. Since accuracy plays a central role in CheShift predictions, the treatment of histidine (His) is investigated here by exploring which form of His should be used in CheShift-2.

@article{Garay2014,
abstract = {Knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of glycans and glycoproteins is useful for a full understanding of molecular processes in which glycans are involved, such as antigen-recognition and virus infection, to name a few. Among the ubiquitous nuclei in glycan molecules, the (13) C nucleus is an attractive candidate for computation of theoretical chemical shifts at the quantum chemical level of theory to validate and determine glycan structures. For this purpose, it is important to determine, first, which carbons can be used as probes to sense conformational changes and, second, all factors that affect the computation of the shielding, at the density functional theory (DFT) level of theory, of those carbons. To answer such questions, we performed a series of analyses on low-energy conformations, obtained by sampling the glycosidic torsional angles (ϕ, $\psi$) every 10°, of 12 disaccharides. Our results provide evidence that: (i) the carbons that participate in the glycosidic linkage are the most sensitive probes with which to sense conformational changes of disaccharides; (ii) the rotation of the hydroxyl groups closest to the glycosidic linkage significantly affects the computation of the shieldings of the carbons that participate in the glycosidic linkage; (iii) it is not possible to obtain the shieldings of one disaccharide from the computed values of a different disaccharide or from those disaccharides that differ in the anomeric state; and (iv) a proper basis set distribution, a functional, and a step size, with which to sample the conformational space, are necessary to compute shieldings accurately and rapidly. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Garay2016,
abstract = {Post-translational modifications of proteins expand the diversity of the proteome by several orders of magnitude and have a profound effect on several biological processes. Their detection by experimental methods is not free of limitations such as the amount of sample needed or the use of destructive procedures to obtain the sample. Certainly, new approaches are needed and, therefore, we explore here the feasibility of using 13 C chemical shifts of different nuclei to detect methylation, acetylation and glycosylation of protein residues by monitoring the deviation of the 13 C chemical shifts from the expected (mean) experimental value of the non-modified residue. As a proof-of-concept, we used 13 C chemical shifts, computed at the DFT-level of theory, to test this hypothesis. Moreover, as a validation test of this approach, we compare our theoretical computations of the 13 C $\epsilon$ chemical-shift values against existing experimental data, obtained from NMR spectroscopy, for methylated and acetylated lysine residues with good agreement within ∼1 ppm. Then, further use of this approach to select the most suitable 13 C-nucleus, with which to determine other modifications commonly seen, such as methylation of arginine and glycosylation of serine, asparagine and threonine, shows encouraging results.},
